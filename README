Overview
========
Allow teachers to easily restore backup courses from Moodle 1.9 to Moodle 2+ systems
It is using the user's ID (username) to get a list of backup courses a user has on the Moodle 1.9 system
And allow him/her to choose one to be silently copied over the network and restored into the current Moodle 2+
system he/she was using this repository from.

The process is relatively secured by a secret key the administrator of both system has to setup initially.

Install
=======

1. git clone https://github.com/mofet/repository_moodle19 (or unzip and copy moodle19 folder into your-moodle2/repository folder)
2. As administrator on the Moodle 2+ system, navigate to "Site Administration -> Plugins -> Repositories -> Manage Repositories -> Moodle19" (http://your-moodle2/admin/repository.php?sesskey=7xxzGV0OT0&action=edit&repos=moodle19)
3. Set the Moodle19 URL and a Secret
4. Copy to file moodle19/remote_moodle19/admin/ws_get_teacher_courses.php to your other moodle 1.9 server under admin/ws_get_teacher_courses.php
5. Copy to file moodle19/remote_moodle19/admin/settings/mnet_moodle2.php to your other moodle 1.9 server under admin/settings/mnet_moodle2.php
6. As administrator on the Moodle 1.9 system, navigate to "Notifications" (to install and first time setup)
Later, as administrator on the Moodle 1.9 system, you can always update the settings at "Home -> Administration -> Networking -> Experimental" (http://your-moodle19/admin/settings.php?section=experimental)
7. Set a common Secret
